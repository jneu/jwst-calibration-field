# jwcf  -  JWST calibration field catalogs

Python interface to the JWST calibration field catalogs.


### Example usage
Access HAWK-I based catalog:        
````
    from jwcf import hawki 
    catalog = hawki.hawki_catalog() 
````    

Access HST based catalog:
````
    from jwcf import hst
    catalog = hst.hst_catalog(decimal_year_of_observation=2022.50)
````
`decimal_year_of_observation` is the
